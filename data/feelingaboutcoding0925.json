Started a bit of interactive programming with Applescript when I was 13 in 2006, and I really wish someone had pushed me to dive deeper into programming at that point. I didn't really get into it enough to make anything useful until college. I did a web development bootcamp at GA after college graduation which was helpful although I could probably have learned it all on my own. "
